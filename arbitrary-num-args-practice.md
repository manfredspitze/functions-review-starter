## Python: Practice
### Using `*args` to Accept Any Number of Arguments Passed to a Function


### Directions

- Have one person on your team write the code
- Everyone on the team should brainstorm a possible solution to each programming challenge
- Be prepared to discuss your solutions with the class

### Challenge 1: Sum of Numbers

- Write a function `calc_sum()` that takes any number of numbers as input and returns the sum of the numbers
- Print the returned sum


### Challenge 2: String Formatter

- Write a function `format_message()` that takes multiple strings and returns a single string
- The single string should display each message in quotation marks and separate each messsage with a comma
- Sample output: `"Hello", "How are you?", "Goodbye"`



### Challenge 3

- Write a function `average_of_numbers( )` that calculates the average of any number of numeric inputs and returns the average as a float.
